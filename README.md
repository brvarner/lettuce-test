# Lettuce Test

Hello! Here's my attempt at the Mobile Developer coding challenge.

I built the project in React Native using Jest to test, with all of the questions and their
answers stored in a JSON file at the root of the project.

I encountered an error that I could never find any information on besides possible dependency mismatches, but if you see an error that begins with: <span style="color:yellow">A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited.</span>, know that I've tried everything to get it to disappear.

Without further ado, here are the setup instructions.

## Setup

1. Start by cloning this project (https://github.com/brvarner/lettuce-test) to your local machine.
2. Run the "npm i" command to install the necessary dependencies.
3. You can start the expo development server by typing "npx expo start" in the terminal when in the project's root folder.
4. If you'd like to activate the Jest testing, which is set to "--watch all --verbose" to re-test on every reload, then type "npm run test" into the terminal when in the project's root folder.
